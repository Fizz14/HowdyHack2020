Hey guys, good luck on this, and thanks for getting up early to work on it. I feel I have been very productive, so hopefully it will be easy for yall to fine tune what we've done.

I think I've found a really good layout, and also notice that the window can be resized, and the elements still have a good order.

If you could, I think it would be really effective to replace the default graphics of tkinter with our own images. Generally, flat is a good style to go with. :D I have made some buttons up/down based on an image I found from google. See if you can incorporate them. At the moment, they don't stretch to fit the buttons from tkinter. you could either find a way to change that or just change the aspect ratios of the image, and find a way to hide the default shitty buttons/radio menus. 

If you get this far, try to use a button down graphic for the textboxes. 

Check the help and what is this buttons, and edit them as you see fit :D

try to do what you can :D

Also, we have to make a video showing the software. Please check everything that has to be in the submission an hour or so in advance.

It would be cool if you submit the console program as well.
